# Logging & Exception Handling in C# Applications

##  Research & Learn

### Best Practices for Logging in C#
- **Use a Mature Logging Library**: Prefer structured logging libraries like **Serilog**, **NLog**, or **log4net** instead of `Console.WriteLine`.
- **Structured Logging**: Include metadata such as timestamps, user/session IDs, log level, and event context.
- **Log Levels**: Apply appropriate severity levels:
  - `Trace` – fine-grained details.
  - `Debug` – debugging information.
  - `Information` – general workflow status.
  - `Warning` – recoverable issues.
  - `Error` – unhandled errors.
  - `Fatal` – critical issues causing shutdown.
- **Avoid Logging Sensitive Data**: Mask or exclude personal information.
- **Multiple Sinks**: Log to multiple outputs – file, console, cloud (e.g., Seq, Azure Monitor).
- **Asynchronous Logging**: Avoid blocking operations by writing logs asynchronously when possible.

### Exception Handling Best Practices
- **Use Try-Catch Blocks Wisely**: Catch exceptions at the appropriate layer; avoid unnecessary catching of `System.Exception`.
- **Log with Context**: Always log exception message, stack trace, and relevant inputs.
- **Don't Swallow Exceptions**: Always handle or propagate exceptions meaningfully.
- **Custom Exceptions**: Create domain-specific exception classes for clarity.
- **Use Finally for Cleanup**: Always release unmanaged resources in `finally` blocks or use `using` statements.

### Patterns for Error Handling in Production Code
- **Global Exception Handling**:
  - Desktop apps: `AppDomain.CurrentDomain.UnhandledException`.
  - Web apps: middleware via `UseExceptionHandler()` in ASP.NET Core.
- **Retry Policies**: Use libraries like **Polly** to handle transient failures (e.g., database timeouts, API retries).
- **Fallbacks and Graceful Degradation**: Provide default values or alternate flows when services fail.
- **Correlation IDs**: Assign IDs to trace logs across microservices or user sessions.
- **Monitoring and Alerts**: Integrate logging with monitoring platforms for proactive error detection.


##  Reflection

### How does effective logging contribute to faster troubleshooting and improved code quality?
Effective logging provides:
- A timeline of operations for debugging.
- Insights into application flow and failures.
- The ability to reproduce issues with contextual information.
- Faster incident resolution, reducing downtime.
- Better collaboration through centralized log access.

### Impact of Exception Handling on Stability and Trust
- Ensures the application doesn't crash unexpectedly.
- Allows consistent handling of known and unknown issues.
- Builds user trust by showing meaningful error messages.
- Preserves application state and prevents data corruption.
- Enables faster recovery and continuity of service.

### Strategies to Enhance Logging in Complex Applications
- **Introduce Logging Standards**: Define what, when, and how to log.
- **Use Structured JSON Logs**: Enables better parsing and querying in log analytics tools.
- **Log Business-Critical Events**: Not just errors—log meaningful business operations.
- **Centralized Logging Infrastructure**: Use tools like Seq, ELK stack, or Azure Monitor.
- **Implement Correlation IDs**: Especially critical in distributed systems or microservices.
- **Environment-Aware Logging**: Adjust verbosity by environment (e.g., Debug in dev, Error in prod).
