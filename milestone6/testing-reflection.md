# Unit Testing for WPF Applications

## Research & Learn

### Unit Testing vs. UI Testing in WPF

| Aspect              | Unit Testing                                | UI Testing                                         |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Scope**           | Tests logic in isolation                     | Tests visual/UI behavior and user interaction      |
| **Speed**           | Fast                                         | Slower due to UI rendering and automation overhead |
| **Dependencies**    | Minimal (mocked dependencies)               | Requires full UI stack and potentially real services |
| **Tools**           | NUnit, MSTest, xUnit                        | White, FlaUI, Appium, Microsoft UI Automation      |
| **Purpose**         | Ensures correctness of business logic       | Ensures usability, interaction correctness, and UI flow |

### Common Testing Frameworks & Tools

- **Unit Testing Frameworks**:
  - **NUnit**: Popular, flexible, easy to integrate.
  - **xUnit**: Lightweight and widely used in .NET Core environments.
  - **MSTest**: Microsoftâ€™s built-in test framework.

- **UI Automation Tools for WPF**:
  - **White**: Legacy tool, still used for basic automation.
  - **FlaUI**: Modern alternative to White, built on UIA3 API.
  - **Microsoft UI Automation (UIA)**: Base framework used by other tools.
  - **TestStack.White**: Provides wrappers around UI elements like buttons, windows.

###  Designing Effective Tests

- **Unit Tests**:
  - Focus on ViewModel and business logic.
  - Use MVVM pattern to decouple UI and logic.
  - Use mock objects or dependency injection for services.

- **UI Tests**:
  - Validate visual states, button click behavior, and user flows.
  - Automate test scenarios like login, navigation, and form submission.
  - Test on multiple screen resolutions when needed.

- **Edge Case Coverage**:
  - Test null inputs, boundary values, invalid formats, empty states.
  - Include assertions for both success and failure outcomes.

## Reflection

### How Does Testing Improve Development?

- Helps **identify bugs early**, reducing cost of fixing them later.
- Encourages writing **clean, testable code** with clear responsibilities.
- Provides **confidence during refactoring** and feature expansion.
- Aids in **continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD)** pipelines.

### Trade-offs: Unit Tests vs. UI Tests

| Factor              | Unit Tests                         | UI Tests                              |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Simplicity**       | Easy to write and maintain          | More complex setup and dependencies     |
| **Execution Speed**  | Very fast                           | Slower (UI rendering required)          |
| **Flakiness**        | Rare                                | More prone to failure due to timing/UI delays |
| **Coverage Type**    | Logic and behavior                  | User experience and workflows           |

While unit tests offer simplicity and speed, UI tests are essential to ensure the full application works as the user expects.


### Strategies for Testing WPF Effectively

- **Follow MVVM**: Test ViewModel logic separately from the View.
- **Use Mocking**: Leverage libraries like Moq for isolating dependencies.
- **Minimal UI Testing**: Focus UI tests on critical workflows only.
- **Automate Tests**: Integrate tests into CI pipelines using tools like Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions.
- **Modular Design**: Keep components small and reusable to ease testability.

## Key Takeaways

- Unit testing is efficient for core logic, while UI testing ensures real-world usability.
- WPF applications benefit from a **testable architecture like MVVM**.
- Using tools like **NUnit** for logic and **FlaUI/White** for UI allows comprehensive coverage.
- A balanced strategy combining unit and UI tests leads to better maintainability, reliability, and user trust.
