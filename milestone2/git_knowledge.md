1. Yes, I have used Git before for publishing my projects and work, both for university assignments and other personal or professional projects. I have utilized Git for managing code repositories, tracking changes, collaborating with teammates, and maintaining project history.
2. I primarily use Git through GitHub, but I also use Git Bash and GitHub Desktop sometimes. GitHub provides an easy-to-use platform for repository hosting and collaboration. Git Bash allows me to work with Git commands in a Unix-like environment, which is useful for advanced operations, while GitHub Desktop provides a graphical interface that simplifies branch management and commit visualization.
3. One of the most interesting things I learned about Git today is the concept of Git rebase and how it differs from Git merge. While both are used to integrate changes from one branch into another, rebase rewrites the commit history by applying changes linearly, whereas merge preserves the history by creating a new merge commit.
