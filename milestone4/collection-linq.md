### Which collection type do you find most useful for different scenarios and why?  

I find List<T> the most useful in day-to-day scenarios because it offers flexibility, easy access to elements, and integrates smoothly with LINQ operations.
When fast lookups by key are needed, I prefer Dictionary<TKey, TValue> â€” especially for managing mappings like user data or configurations.   

### What are the common collection types in C#?

- **List<T>**: A dynamic array that can grow and shrink in size.
- **Dictionary<TKey, TValue>**: A collection of key-value pairs for fast lookup.
- **Array**: A fixed-size, strongly typed collection of elements.
- **HashSet<T>**: A collection that contains only unique elements.
- **Queue<T>**: A first-in, first-out (FIFO) collection.
- **Stack<T>**: A last-in, first-out (LIFO) collection.
- **LinkedList<T>**: A collection that allows efficient insertions and deletions.

### How does LINQ simplify data queries compared to traditional loops and conditional logic?

LINQ (Language Integrated Query) allows developers to query collections in a declarative style similar to SQL. Instead of writing verbose `foreach` loops and `if` conditions, LINQ lets you express the desired result directly using concise, readable syntax.
