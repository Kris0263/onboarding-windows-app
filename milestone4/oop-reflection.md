# Object-Oriented Programming in C#

## Goal
Learn the core principles of object-oriented programming (OOP) in C# and understand how to apply them in building maintainable and scalable applications.

## Why is this important?
OOP is fundamental to creating modular code. Grasping concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction is essential for solving complex problems and designing robust systems.

## Research & Learn

### What are the four main pillars of OOP in C#?
1. Encapsulation
2. Inheritance
3. Polymorphism
4. Abstraction

### How do concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation manifest in C# code?
- **Encapsulation**: Achieved using access modifiers (private, public, protected).
- **Inheritance**: One class inherits properties and methods from another.
- **Polymorphism**: Different classes can define their own versions of a method.

### Which design patterns leverage OOP principles?
- Factory Pattern
- Singleton Pattern
- Strategy Pattern
- Observer Pattern

## Reflection

### Which OOP principle did you find most challenging and why?
I found **Abstraction** most challenging because deciding what details to hide and what to expose takes careful design thinking.

### How does applying OOP concepts enhance code reusability and maintainability?
OOP enables us to build modular, reusable, and easily maintainable code by separating concerns and reducing duplication.

### Reflect on a scenario where using OOP made a project easier to manage.
In a vehicle simulation project, using inheritance and polymorphism allowed easy addition of new vehicle types without rewriting large portions of the codebase.
