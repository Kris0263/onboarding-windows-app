### Simplicity  
Simplicity in coding means writing code that is easy to follow and free from unnecessary complexity. Avoiding redundant logic, minimizing dependencies, and using clear and concise constructs make code more approachable.  

### Readability  
Readable code is code that can be understood quickly by developers. Using meaningful variable and function names, proper indentation, and comments where necessary enhances readability. Code should be structured in a way that a developer unfamiliar with it can grasp its functionality with minimal effort.  

### Maintainability  
Maintainability ensures that code is easy to modify and extend over time. This involves writing modular and well-documented code, following best practices, and avoiding tightly coupled dependencies. The goal is to make future debugging and feature additions smooth and efficient.  

### Consistency  
Consistent code follows established coding conventions and style guides. Whether itâ€™s naming conventions, indentation, or function structures, sticking to a uniform pattern makes collaboration easier and reduces confusion when working in teams.

### Efficiency  
Efficient code performs tasks optimally without unnecessary resource usage. Avoid premature optimizations but strive to write code that balances performance and maintainability. Proper data structures and algorithms should be used to ensure performance bottlenecks are minimized.
